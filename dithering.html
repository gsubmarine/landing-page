            <h3> 2025 Predictions - 01/12/2025</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fed cuts interest rates by 1%
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPI is 33% composed of housing cost. 7.5% rent, 25% owner equivelant rent.</li>
                        <li>Increased supply and interest rates will result in real estate prices cooling. In H2, fed will cut rates more than expected.</li>
                        <li>There may be a lag in housing price reporting because owners tendancy to de-list instead of dropping prices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Something on household shelves is recalled/banned by FDA

                        <li>EU allows 400 additives, FDA approves 3000</li>
                        <li>Food coloring & flour/grain have entered the overton window. EU already bans Potassium Bromate & red40.</li>
                        <li>most milk already sells without growth hormone (rBGH/rBST). This would be an easy policy win with no actual impact. Already banned in EU.</li>
